In this project, completed for CSCI 350: Databases and Structures
My partner and I were given creative freedom to wrangle a dataset of our choosing, and analyze it using a supervised machine learning model.
We sought to uncover patterns, build predictive models, and draw meaningful conclusions based on real-world data.

This [Jupyter Notebook](FifaOveralls.ipynb) contains our full analysis, model building, and evaluation.
