Project "Fifa Overalls" was completed for CSCI 350: Databases and Structures.
My partner and I were given creative freedom to wrangle a dataset of our choosing, and analyze it using a supervised machine learning model.
We sought to uncover patterns, build linear regression and predictive random forest models about player rating, and draw meaningful conclusions based on a variety of player attributes.

This [Jupyter Notebook](FifaOveralls.ipynb) contains our brief analysis, model building using decision trees, and evaluation.

Project "MJ Win Factor" The next project was completed during the same course.
Using machine learning techniques and confusion matrix analysis, we explored various thresholds of points scored by Michael Jordan to predict the likelihood of a Chicago Bulls win, identifying key patterns in his performance that influence his team's success.
